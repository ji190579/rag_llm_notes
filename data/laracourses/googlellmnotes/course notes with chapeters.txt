Chapter 1: Introduction to the Program and AI Engineering
1.1 Program Overview and Goals This program aims to help individuals, regardless of their location in the Arab world, learn how to find well-paying global jobs in AI companies. The program offers a comprehensive plan covering required skills. The goal is for participants to take the provided roadmap and use it to create their own learning path, ultimately becoming proficient AI engineers. The program emphasizes benefiting from resources that might not be taught extensively in schools or universities. It covers topics ranging from fundamental skills like Python and data handling to more advanced areas such as deep learning, NLP, and computer vision, as well as career aspects like model deployment and interview preparation. The program is designed to cover these topics step-by-step, introducing new points each month.
1.2 About the Speaker (Lara Wehbe) Lara Wehbe, the speaker, is a self-taught AI Engineer. She learned AI on her own around 2019-2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when resources and clear paths for learning AI were not widely available, particularly in Lebanon. Before that, she studied Telecommunications Engineering at the Lebanese University. She emphasizes that the learning path she followed in 2019-2020 is not the same as the path needed today because the field is constantly changing. Her experience includes conducting over 50 to 100 job interviews over four years.
1.3 AI Engineering vs. Data Science The speaker notes that when applying for jobs advertised as AI Engineering positions, sometimes up to half the job involves data science tasks. This can be surprising as what people learn might differ from the job requirements. While data science is a great job and an integral part of AI, it's important to know exactly what role you will be fulfilling in the job market. This program intends to clarify the difference between AI Engineering, Data Science, and Software Engineering.
1.4 Importance of a Structured Learning Path The speaker highlights that AI is a field where many people are self-taught. The program offers a structured roadmap to help individuals learn, consolidating resources that the speaker used and making them accessible. This structured approach is crucial because the field changes rapidly, and knowing the right path is essential. The program provides a general workflow that starts with deciding to learn, checking existing knowledge (like Python), and then progressing through stages like data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.
Chapter 2: Foundational Skills and Concepts
2.1 Math Requirements for AI There is a debate about whether extensive math knowledge is necessary for AI. Some believe you cannot learn AI without knowing a lot of math, while others say you only need the required math. The speaker believes that you don't need to be very strong in math to find a job in AI. For applying AI concepts or using existing libraries, basic math understanding (like knowing what a derivative is used for or understanding matrix multiplication for neural networks) is often sufficient. However, for those who want to invent new algorithms, deep dive into the underlying mechanisms, or work on projects from scratch (like creating a new language model), a much deeper understanding of math is definitely required. The program aims to teach the necessary math without going into excessive detail unless needed for specific advanced topics.
2.2 Programming Fundamentals (Python) Python is a fundamental skill required for AI.
•
Data Types, Loops, Functions: Basic programming concepts like data types, loops, and functions are essential. Loops, for instance, are crucial for iterating through data, especially with large datasets. There are different types of loops, like for loops, and more advanced concepts like list comprehension.
•
Code Cleaning and Abstraction: Writing clean code and understanding abstraction (like writing functions to avoid repeating code) is important, especially when working with large codebases.
•
Code Efficiency: Understanding which data structure or method to use for large datasets (e.g., Lists vs. Dictionaries vs. Sets) is crucial for efficiency and is a common interview question.
2.3 Data Handling Libraries (Numpy, Pandas)
•
Numpy: This library is crucial for working with numerical data, especially arrays and vectors, which are fundamental for representing images and other data in AI. Knowing how to create, manipulate, slice, and index Numpy arrays is a key skill.
•
Pandas: This library simplifies importing data from various formats (Excel, CSV, SQL, etc.) into DataFrames. DataFrames allow you to organize data like in a spreadsheet and perform operations on it easily. Pandas is user-friendly and important for data manipulation and cleaning.
2.4 Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) These libraries are used for data visualization, which helps in understanding data distribution and patterns. Visualizing data is a very important step in data analysis.
2.5 Model Evaluation Metrics Understanding how to evaluate the performance of a model is critical. Key metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and the Confusion Matrix. These metrics help determine how well a model is performing, identify issues like overfitting or underfitting, and understand if the model is correctly identifying positive and negative cases. For example, high precision but low recall suggests the model is good at identifying true positives but misses many actual positives.
Chapter 3: Machine Learning and Deep Learning
3.1 Rule-Based vs. Machine Learning Approaches AI problems can sometimes be approached with rule-based systems (e.g., using if-else conditions). However, this approach becomes impractical and complex for real-world scenarios with countless variables and conditions (e.g., a self-driving car encountering unpredictable situations). Machine Learning provides a solution by allowing models to adapt and learn from data without explicit programming for every scenario.
3.2 Machine Learning Concepts and Libraries (Scikit-learn) After learning programming fundamentals and data handling, the next step is to learn Machine Learning basics. Scikit-learn is mentioned as an easy-to-use library for implementing machine learning algorithms like classification and regression. Understanding concepts like how algorithms work fundamentally (e.g., the difference between Logistic Regression and Linear Regression) is important.
3.3 Deep Learning Fundamentals (Neural Networks) Deep Learning involves using neural networks, which are inspired by the structure of the human brain. Neural networks take input data, process it through layers with weights, and produce output data. The learning process involves updating these weights based on how well the model performs, allowing it to improve. Neural networks are a full course topic.
3.4 Deep Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) TensorFlow and PyTorch are major frameworks for building and training deep learning models. Learning one of these is essential for deep learning. While their syntax differs, the underlying principles are similar, so learning one makes it easier to pick up the other. The program plans to cover TensorFlow first, then potentially PyTorch.
3.5 Model Deployment and Production (MLOps) A significant challenge is taking a trained AI model and deploying it online for others to use. Often, more than 50% of AI projects made globally never make it past the development stage because of difficulties in deployment. Factors like cost, speed, and security are critical for production environments. Packaging models into APIs is a common method for making them accessible and integrable. The process of putting models into production is very important and will be discussed later in the program. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the term for this field. This involves understanding infrastructure and automation pipelines.
Chapter 4: AI Specializations and Advanced Topics
4.1 Importance of Specialization It's crucial to specialize in a specific area of AI rather than trying to know a little bit about everything. While starting broad to see what interests you is fine, companies eventually seek specialists. The course aims to introduce various fields before focusing on specialization tracks. Specialization options mentioned include NLP, Computer Vision, and Generative AI.
4.2 Natural Language Processing (NLP) NLP deals with enabling computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.
•
Basic NLP Concepts: This involves understanding how to process and analyze text.
•
Advanced NLP: More advanced topics include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), used for sequential data like text. However, these have limitations, such as forgetting earlier parts of long texts (the "Downfall" of RNNs). This led to the development of the Transformer architecture and the Attention mechanism. Attention allows models to "remember" and focus on relevant parts of the input text, regardless of length. Understanding the Attention mechanism, potentially including its underlying math, is important.
•
Hugging Face Library: Hugging Face provides a vast collection of open-source models (over 1 million) for NLP and other tasks. These models can be downloaded and fine-tuned for specific uses. It's highly recommended to start exploring Hugging Face now. NLP is a fundamental and highly demanded field today.
4.3 Computer Vision (CV) Computer Vision focuses on enabling computers to "see" and interpret images and videos.
•
OpenCV Library: OpenCV is a primary library for image processing and computer vision tasks. It's the first step for anyone specializing in this area.
•
YOLO Models: YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a series of models used for object detection. Trying out YOLO models for personal projects (like identifying objects in photos) can be a good way to learn CV.
4.4 Time Series Analysis This area focuses on analyzing data points collected over time, such as weather forecasting, stock prices, or economic indicators. While important, the program will focus more on deep learning first.
4.5 Recommender Systems These systems predict what a user might like, based on their past behavior or preferences. The speaker has worked on such systems, including developing models for different Arabic dialects.
4.6 Generative AI Generative AI is the most recent prominent field, gaining global attention around November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT. However, generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can create realistic images, have existed since earlier (around 2017-2018).
•
GANs and Diffusion Models: These models can generate new content, such as images. Diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion) can generate images based on text prompts.
•
Applications: Generative AI is used for tasks like text generation, image generation, and potentially creating specialized models for specific domains (medical, political, economic, etc.).
4.7 Foundation Models These are large models trained by major companies. They can be taken and fine-tuned for specific tasks, which is a common practice. The principle is "don't do something someone else has done if you can use and modify theirs".
Chapter 5: Career Development and the Job Market
5.1 When to Start Applying for Jobs The speaker advises starting to apply for jobs once you begin the deep learning section of the course and feel you are gaining proficiency (e.g., after a few weeks). Applying allows you to gain hands-on experience with the tools and concepts used in companies. You don't need to wait until you finish everything.
5.2 Interview Preparation (Mock Interviews) Interviewing is a skill that needs practice. The program will include mock interviews to help participants prepare for common questions asked for AI Engineer roles, which can sometimes be surprisingly basic and not typically covered in depth in traditional courses or university. The speaker's experience includes over 50-100 interviews. Practicing interviews proves your skills.
5.3 Job Opportunities (Local and Global) Learning AI opens up opportunities for both local and global jobs. The market is not limited to specific locations. Companies in places like the US, Canada, and Dubai are hiring remotely from locations like Lebanon.
5.4 Remote Work in AI Remote work is very common in the AI field. The speaker has worked remotely for companies in multiple countries. Companies may hire remotely from regions like Lebanon to reduce costs while accessing highly skilled professionals.
5.5 Career Transition to AI (from other fields) It is possible to transition into an AI career from other fields, even those seemingly unrelated like Civil Engineering. The key is to pursue AI education, potentially through Masters programs or self-study, and build relevant skills. Having a software engineering background is advantageous when moving into AI, particularly for understanding software development life cycles and system architecture. Companies value experienced software engineers transitioning into AI roles.
5.6 Importance of Continuous Learning AI is a field of continuous learning. You can never say you've finished learning everything. New developments are constantly emerging. It's important to stay updated on new releases and technologies, but avoid trying to learn everything simultaneously.
5.7 The Value of Community Learning within a community is highly beneficial. Discussing topics with others and learning from their questions and experiences helps keep everyone updated and supported. The program aims to build a community for this purpose.
Chapter 6: Learning Resources and Strategies
6.1 Program's Roadmap and Structure The program provides a roadmap starting with fundamentals (Python, Data Analysis) and progressing to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Specializations (NLP, CV). Each month focuses on new topics. The learning material is provided on a platform (classroom) where participants can watch courses and mark progress.
6.2 Recommended External Resources (Books, Courses) The speaker recommends external resources, including specific books like "Mathematics for Machine Learning," which she found very helpful. Other courses and resources that influenced the program's structure are also mentioned as beneficial.
6.3 Effective Learning Strategies (Focus, Practice, Community)
•
Focus: It's crucial to focus on one area or topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Trying to learn everything at once is ineffective.
•
Practice: Doing projects is essential for hands-on experience. Building projects helps you apply concepts and stand out. Start applying for jobs while learning to gain practical experience.
•
Community: Engaging with a community helps share knowledge, ask questions, and stay motivated.
6.4 Addressing Common Concerns (Being Behind, Overwhelm) Many people feel they are behind or that the field is too vast. The speaker advises against this feeling. Continuous learning is normal in AI, and no one knows everything. The structured program and community support are designed to mitigate these feelings. The program pace (around 3-4 months for core AI Engineering skills) is reasonable given the breadth of the field.
6.5 Dealing with Marketing Hype There is a lot of marketing hype around AI, with programs promising to make you an AI Engineer quickly. It's important to find reliable resources and a structured path rather than getting sidetracked by every new trend or tool. The program aims to provide a solid foundation.
based on above when i can enter job market?

Based on the source, you can start applying for AI jobs once you begin the Deep Learning section of the roadmap and feel you are starting to master it. The speaker suggests that a week, two, or three weeks after starting the Deep Learning course and feeling comfortable with the material is a good time to begin applying. You don't need to wait until you have completely finished the Deep Learning section or the entire roadmap.
Here's a bit more context from the source regarding the path to becoming an AI engineer and entering the job market:
